Hello, welcome to my first blog post!  
I'll be honest, I don't even plan to write any posts, I just implemented a blog for fun.  
But in case I do, this is a test of the features of this blog.

Code blocks!

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	cin.sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0)
    
	cout<<"bruh moment";
}
```

Inline `code` as well!

I like maths, so katex math equations as well:

$\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
