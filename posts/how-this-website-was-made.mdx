# Backstory

My personal website used to be a Bootstrap template. I decided to create a new one from scratch using some cool new technologies to get some web dev experience. So, here's a quick post on the design of this website!

# Tech Stack

Here's the epic Jamstack I used!

* Next.js (React)
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* Firebase to store page views
* Forestry.io as a Headless CMS
* Katex for math typesetting
* Three.js for WebGL 3D graphics
* Deployed on Vercel

I went with Next.js because I knew most of my site would be static content like posts and whatnot, so I wanted a static site generator. Plus, it would also let me sharpen my React skills.

I styled the site with Tailwind because it seemed pretty popular, and it gives you a lot of customization opposed to a UI kit like Bootstrap.

I knew I would be updating my projects frequently, so I went with Forestry.io as a headless content management system. This lets me update blog posts and projects in an easy-to-use UI.

I also used three.js to add that 3D text on the home page. I've seen some really cool 3D sites, so I thought it would be cool to put some 3D effects in my website as well.

# Design

I'm not a designer by any stretch of the imagination, so I went for a pretty simple look. It's also completely dark theme, because I like dark themes :)

# Conclusion

Remaking my website was definitely a good decision. My website represents me better, and it's much easier to update. Most importantly, I learned a TON about web development. Epic
